As Alessandro Cantatore do not work any more on ACDataSeeker, I've asked him to
give me the sources. He kindly agreed. So I've made my own build starting with
his 0.46 version. Please report missing/broken functions in my build compared
to Alessandros last version. If you like DataSeeker, please mail me a feedback
and thank Alessandro for his generousity.

There are only little help file updates from me. If you want to contribute and
update the help file or make translations, drop me a mail. Starting with version
1.0 I've included National Language Support via (eco)Lange. Requirements:
eCo Software runtime (base) -- http://ecomstation.ru/ecosoft/runtime.php.

DataSeeker subjects to Modified BSD License. Portions of code subjects to Sybase
Open Watcom Public License.


Prerequisite:
-------------
- OS/2 or eCS. Warp 3 and up. I've tested mainly with eCS2.1DE and eCS1.2r
- MMPMCRTS.DLL and SW.DLL from the OS/2 Multimedia subsystem (usually found
  in x:\MMOS2\DLL\). See Q5: below

Optional components:
--------------------
- The debug version DataSeeker_debug.exe needs PmPrintf.dll. Get it from hobbes
  (PMPrintf253.zip or newer)
- For debbuging reports in case of a crash exceptq.dll v7.1 is required. Please
  install exceptq71.zip or newer from f.i. hobbes before you report crashes and
  include the *.TRP file created in the directory DataSeek.exe resides.

Thes following components are usually installed on newer systems by default. If
not DataSeeker works but some functionality is disabled
- For National Language Support ECOLANGE.DLL is required. It is included in
  eCo Software runtime (base)
- For file/dir selection with '...' button FOC.DLL is required. It is included
  in eCo Software runtime (win). For an updated foc.nls see Q3: below.


Installation:
-------------
See help file. (Unziping and dragging a reference on your desktop is okay)


Questions / answeres :
----------------------
Q1: Pop-up menu do not work / works only on some areas
A1: Add DataSeek.exe to DragText - Setup - Disable list and disable Drag for
  Entry Fields, List Boxes, Combo Boxes and Static Text

Q2: How to change the language used by DataSeeker
A2: The ecoruntime uses the enviroment variable LANG to determine which language
  to use. LANG is usually set in your config.sys but you can change it in a
  command shell prior of starting DataSeeker. In this case DataSeeker have to
  be started from the very same command shell. Of course the translation into
  the selected language have to be made prior. Currently DataSeeker supports
  English, French, Spanish, Nederlands, Russia and German. See Translator.txt
  for info how to translate into other languages. If ecolange.dll is not found
  on your system translation do not work. Check the About dialog.

Q3: All texts are displayed in my native language but in the FOC dialog all
  or some text is displayed in English (f.i. with german Systems Cancel button)
  even with correct text in the XX_XX language file
A3: Translations for FOC dialog is not handled by DataSeeker. Exceptions are the
  title bar and OK button. Translation for other text is usually located in
  x:\ecs\lang\foc.nls. Ask eCoSoft for an updated version for your language.
  German users may download a corrected version at
  http://web.utanet.at/abuchin1/Download/foc.nls

Q4: What does the red box mean labeled 'No more than xx search criteria allowed'
A4: There's a limited number of different files/strings to search in one pass.
  You may reach the internal limit especially when you select a lot of drive
  letters in the drive selection dialog. Remember, each file definition entered
  in the 'Files to search' field separeted by the OR operator ( | ) is searched
  on all selected drives which gives Files x Drives search criteria. f.i.
  searching for files '*txt|rea*|*repor*|*feedback*' on 15 drives at the
  same time will end up in 60 search criteria!

Q5: MMPMCRTS.DLL, SW.DLL...
A5: These dlls are part of the OS/2 - eCS Multimedia subsystem. If you have not
  installed MM support on your system please extract these dlls from your eCS -
  OS/2 installation medium. Starting with 0.51b DataSeeker can not work without
  these dlls.

Q6: What's the DataSeek_debug.exe? Or, why does it not start?
A6: The debug version prints some debugging messages to Dennis Bareis PMPRINTF.
  You can download a modified version from hobbes or my home page. You need
  pmprintf.dll somewhere in your libpath. If it isn't found, DataSeek_debug.exe
  can't work. I like to say A BIG THANK YOU TO DENNIS FOR HIS INVALUABLE TOOL.
  Pmprintf will give you some infos what DataSeeker does and in case of
  problems, maybe it gives you some clue what's going wrong. It may be usefull
  too if you have troubles to find out how boolean operations works on search
  arguments ;-)

Q7: What are the F, H, N, C... in front of the drive letters in the drives menu?
A7: Means Floppy, Harddisk, Network, CD-ROM... It is planned to show an icon in
  front of the drive letter instead of this character in a future version.

Q8: DataSeeker does not start - the system seems to hang instead
A8: Try to kill the DataSeeker process (f.i. with TOP started from CAD-handler
  which is usually installed with eCS) or wait 10s and delete DataSeek.INI then.

Q9: My file history lists are gone after installing the newest version
A9: When the ini file format changes as with version 1.10 not all old settings
  can be savely imported. There is a risk of application trap when importing
  these lists from older ini files so I've disable this. This is only an issue
  when starting the new version the first time. Afterwards the lists are
  restored as usual. See Q8: above also.

20090823 0.52b:
0.52b is a major step towards 1.0. There a only a few cosmetic changes left I
like to do before I think 1.0 is ready. As the Large File support was more
complex than expected, I like to make this version public for feedback if
I've broken something. So give feedback
- update of What's new section in help file
- added large file (>= 2GB) support available since Warp Server for e-business
- max. line length for text searches is now 5MB (text search in binary files)
- tested with files up to 9.5GB and more than 30000 text matches
- limited testing has been done with Warp3
- fixed crash when try to start editor and no .ini entry is set for it

20090319 0.51b:
added
- check on start if window is in visible area and move if not (f.i. if in
  another xpager window)

- Drive selection window which is been used when no drive specifier is entered
  in 'Files to search for'

- fixed ticket #2 - search options (recursive, case...) did not work without
  close and reopen DataSeeker

20081115 0.50b:
fixed
- ignore leading blanks in directory specification (This may be a problem, when
  you have a directory name starting with a blank. If you want to search in such
  a directory, start searching with the parent directory instead.)
- prevent selection of first entry in Files found when user has scrolled or
  selected a file during search
- removed another few ':' in strings. Hope now found all ;-)
- cosmetic change on Files found... Elapsed time string

Note - I like to make this version public cause I plan to add a feature to
search on 'default' drives if no drive is specified. I fear this will take
considerable time so don't expect updates in the near future.

20081115 0.49b:
fixed
- enclose filename with " for opening in MED or VS
- <CTRL><P> (upper case) accelerator did not work

added
- <CTRL><C> copy filename enclosed with " to clipboard
- <CTRL><SHIFT><C> copy selected line to clipboard


20080903 0.48b:
fixed
- disable 'Selected' menu item on startup (crash when no file is selected)
- CTRL-E, CTRL-P accelerators reenabled
- appStart new flag to distinguish between editor/cli and WinSwitchToProgram
  (window list pops up when starting editor, probably introduced with 0.47)

changed
- removed scroll bars
- added ... to Settings menu item and removed : on various texts
- removed sub menus from 'View'
- Files/Text to search drop down box reduced size to not overlap Search button
- calling EPM now with 'postme'
- files/text search drop down list boxes - entries not sorted alphapeticaly any
   more


20080824 0.47b:

changed
- First build from me (Andreas Buchinger). Lot of changes were necessary to
  build the GUI with URE. At this times, I don't want to build an application
  without a useful GUI editor. On OS/2 I think URE is the only usable one.
  There were a lot of changes necessary to get that beast compiled cleanly with
  my build enviroment. So maybe I've some things broken. While rebuilding the
  GUI, I've made some changes to the menus. I think they were not consistent
  with usual OS/2 look and feel. So I've changed that.

fixed
- crash when no editor or cmd shell is found in ini file
- crash when no editor or cmd shell is entered in settings dialog

added
- support for MED and VS (VisualSlickEdit) as editors (beside EPM)
- select first found text entry to start editor with approbiate line when double
   clicking on the file name
- when opening a cmd shell, switch to it (put focus on the cli window)
- add '*' if files to search is directory (simple check only - end with \ or :)
- scroll bars for Files/Text found list boxes
