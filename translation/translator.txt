Translating DataSeeker:
-----------------------
Unzip DataSeek.NLS - this is a standard zip file. Edit the appropriate file in
.\NLS directory. Change the text after the equal sign (=) into the target
language. Zip all files in .\NLS to DataSeek.nls. Check if DataSeek.nls is in
the same directory than DataSeeker.exe. Next time DataSeeker starts in the
language defined by your system enviroment variable lang (echo %lang%). You can
try another language by setting the LANG enviroment variable. To do this open a
command shell, change into your DataSeeker directory, type f.i. 'set LANG=de_DE'
and start DataSeeker from this command shell.

Use the following command to zip all language files from within the NLS
directory -
cd NLS
zip ..\DataSeek.nls *

Translating the help file:
--------------------------
If exists the help file mentioned in the appropriate NLS file (HelpFile=) is
used. To translate into other languages you have to generate a proper *.ipf
file, compile it with the ipf compiler (f.i. ipfc -i -D:1 -C:850 -L:ENU *.ipf)
and rename the generated *.inf file to DataSeek_XX.hlp. You can use DataSeek.ipf
as a template. Be careful to change only text in the .ipf file especially if you
do not know the .ipf syntax.
