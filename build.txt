Notes on building DataSeeker
----------------------------

20131124
IRE bug - does not honor 'MLS_LIMITVSCROLL' in DLG_ABOUT and DLG_FOC_FAIL. Add
it MANUALLY every time IRE writes to DataSeeker.Rc

Compiler - IBMCPP 3.65

Maybe toolkit 4.5 (os2tk45.zip) is needed too - I have it installed and
%include% is set in my config.sys

ressource compiler - usually v5 (Version 5.00.004 May 12 1999) named rc5.exe on
my system. But sometimes I use v4 (Version 4.00.010 Apr 26 1999) which gives
better/other error messages (comment in makefile)

GUI made with URE (hobbes) - no hand made entries in .rc file!

make - nmake from IBMCPP3.65 or 3.08 or os2tk45 ???
2 cmd files make.cmd and make_release.cmd are used (DBUILD.cmd and RBUILD.cmd
are Alessandros original scripts but I do not use it).
- make.cmd does a debug build which traces infos to pmprintf (needs pmprintf.dll
  in your libpath) and all debug infos icdebug (IBMCPP3.65 debugger) needs.
- make_release.cmd does a release build without debug infos.

I usually start a build with <F5> within VisualSlickEdit4.0.
<CTRL><SHFT><up/down) jumps directly to the source line which causes a build
error. The .vpj file is the VS project file. If you want the most powerful
programmers editor for OS/2 - eCS, get VisualSlickEdit. Unfortunatly VS4 needs
absolute path in pogram/properties/file list. So all project files are with full
path in DataSeek.vpj. You have to change if you use VS4 and a different path for
the source files. Otherwise VS4 behaves very weird. Like opening 10 ore more
buffers for the same file, or opening completely different file after search
over all project files...

envicc365.cmd used in make.cmd sets my enviroment. It basically calls a
modified version of P:\IBMCPP3.65\BIN\SETENV.CMD. To see nice colored output
instead of the escape sequences, you have to enabled ANSI support for command
lines.

My setenv.cmd looks like -
---------------------------

/* Setting enviroment for VAC3.65 */
HaveEnv = ""
/* check if CPP3.65 in PATH and exit if yes */
IF LastPos('P:\IBMCPP3.65' , value( 'path', , 'OS2ENVIRONMENT')) >  0  THEN HaveEnv = "TRUE"

IF HaveEnv = "TRUE" THEN
        DO
        rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[36;1m')
        say 'IBMCPP3.65 Enviroment already set'
        rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[0m')
        RETURN
        END

rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[31;1m')
say 'Don''t have IBMCPP3.65 enviroment, setting now'
rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[0m')

"SET COMPILER365=YES"

"SET CXXMAIN=P:\IBMCPP3.65"


"SET BEGINLIBPATH=%CXXMAIN%\DLL;%BEGINLIBPATH%"
"SET DPATH=%CXXMAIN%\HELP;%CXXMAIN%\LOCALE;%DPATH%"
"SET HELP=%CXXMAIN%\HELP;%HELP%"
"SET INCLUDE=%CXXMAIN%\INCLUDE;%INCLUDE%"
"SET IPFC=%CXXMAIN%\BIN;%IPFC%"
"SET LIB=%CXXMAIN%\LIB;%LIB%"
"SET CPP_DBG_LANG=CPP"
"SET LANG=en_us"
"SET NLSPATHTEMP=%CXXMAIN%\MSG\%%N"
"SET NLSPATH=%NLSPATHTEMP%;%NLSPATH%"
"SET NLSPATHTEMP="
"SET PATH=%CXXMAIN%\BIN;%PATH%"


rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[36;1m')
say "Enviroment for VACPP3.65 is now set correctly"
rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[0m')



My EnvTK45.cmd checks if the toolkit is in the INCLUDE env _before_ the
CPP3.65. It looks like -
---------------------------

/* Check if os2tk45 is already set in INCLUDE */
HaveIncTK = ""

IncVar = value( 'include', , 'OS2ENVIRONMENT')
IncVar = TRANSLATE(IncVar)

/* say IncVar */

pos45 = Pos('OS2TK45\H' , IncVar)
pos365 = Pos('IBMCPP3.65\INCLUDE' ,IncVar)

/* check if os2tk45 is in INCLUDE _before_ ibmcpp3.65\include*/
IF pos365 > 0 THEN
    DO
    IF pos365 > pos45 THEN HaveIncTK = "TRUE"
    END
ELSE
    DO
    IF pos45 >  0  THEN HaveIncTK = "TRUE"
    END



/*say "os2tk45 " pos45
say "ibmcpp3.65 " pos365 */

IF HaveIncTK = "TRUE" THEN
        DO
        rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[36;1m')
        say 'Include to os2tk45\h already set'
        rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[0m')
        RETURN
        END

/* Using os2tk45 enviroment instead of ibmcpp365 include files (for tcpip 32-bit stack for mbmon2 widget) */
rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[31;1m')
say 'Setting include to os2tk45\...'
rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[0m')
"SET INCLUDE=P:\os2tk45\h;P:\OS2TK45\SOM\INCLUDE;P:\OS2TK45\INC;P:\OS2TK45\H\GL;P:\OS2TK45\H\LIBC;%INCLUDE%"
rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[36;1m')
say 'Include to os2tk45\h sucessfully set'
rc=charout(,'1b'x||'[0m')
